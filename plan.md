# Project Roadmap: Job Alert App

## ðŸ”¹ Core Pieces to Learn
1. **Web Framework (app skeleton)**
   - Purpose: expose APIs, manage users, structure project
   - Options: Django (all-in-one), FastAPI (modern, lightweight)

2. **Database (store data)**
   - Purpose: store websites, users, jobs found
   - Options: PostgreSQL (market standard), SQLite (easy start)

3. **Scraping / Data Fetching**
   - Purpose: get jobs from websites
   - Tools: Requests + BeautifulSoup
   - Alternative: use APIs if websites provide them

4. **Background Tasks (automation)**
   - Purpose: check websites automatically
   - Tools: Celery, APScheduler, or cron jobs

5. **Notifications**
   - Purpose: send alerts (email) when new jobs appear
   - Start: Django email backend or Python `smtplib`
   - Later: external services (SendGrid, Mailgun)

6. **Authentication (optional for multi-user)**
   - Django: built-in user system
   - FastAPI: JWT tokens

7. **Deployment**
   - Purpose: make app available online
   - Options: Heroku, Railway, Render

1. User registers a company website to follow  
2. Website URL saved in the database  
3. Background task checks site regularly  
4. New job found â†’ save in DB â†’ send email notification  
5. API / frontend lets user view their tracked jobs

## ðŸ”¹ Learning Approach
- Learn one piece at a time â†’ connect later
- Example path:
  1. Scraping in a standalone script  
  2. Save scraped results in a database  
  3. Build an API with Django/FastAPI  
  4. Add automation (background tasks)  
  5. Send email notifications  
  6. Add authentication (if needed)  
  7. Deploy
